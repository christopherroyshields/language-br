# PureBasic language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to PureBasic files in Atom.

The snippets contain all constants, keywords and procedures which come with PureBasic by default. In addition basic code block snippets as for procedures are provided, too.

If you use PureUnit, check out the [language-pureunit](https://atom.io/packages/language-pureunit) package.

## Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated! I can only work on this package occasionally. The work is easy but time consuming. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets or make grammar tweaks. Feel free to report problems, improvement suggestions or feature requests [in the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/peterthomashorn/language-purebasic/issues).

For information on how to specify the language grammar see: [TextMate language grammars](http://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars).
